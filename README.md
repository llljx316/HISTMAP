# About
In recent years, various features have been extracted from historical maps thanks to advancements in machine learning. While the content of maps is relatively well studied, elements around the maps still deserve some attention. These elements are used, amongst others, for decoration (e.g. ornamentation, cartouches), orientation (e.g. scale bar, wind rose, north arrow), illustration (e.g. heraldic, figures, landscape scenes), and description (e.g. title, explanations, legend). The analysis of the style and arrangement of these elements will give valuable hints about the cartographer’s background.
